            How It Works
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700">
            As a certified strategic life coach, my process is centered around
            creating a supportive, empowering partnership that helps you move
            from a place of confusion to a place of clarity and empowerment. I
            work with clients through a structured yet flexible process that
            allows for both the inner and outer work that it takes to move into
            a life you love and most desire. Each client is unique and depending
            on their needs I will use different tools and assessments.
